# Covaid - Covid Aid Platform

Covaid = Covid + Aid

The main goal of this platform is to provide accurate and realtime information about availablity of oxygen cylinders, plasma donators and hospital beds.
This will be managed by the users themself. Anyone can post the information and people can verify and update the current status. 

### How it works

- Post the information like name, contact and address about the supplier, donator or the hospital.
- Others can check the post according to their searched location or current geolocation.
- Unupdated Posts older than 14 days will be deleted automatically.
- Users can verify the posts and can update the current stock or status about the same.
- Foul posts can be marks spam or be reported, and after three spams the post will be deleted automatically.
