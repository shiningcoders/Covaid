# Covaid - Covid Aid Platform
Covaid = Covid + Aid

The main goal of this platform is to provide accurate and realtime information about availablity of oxygen cylinders, plasma donators and hospital beds.
This will be managed by the users themself. Anyone can post the information and people can verify and update the current status.
